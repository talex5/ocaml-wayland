They can present wl_buffers, receive user input, and define a local coordinate system.</p><p>The size of a surface (and relative positions on it) is described in surface-local coordinates, which may differ from the buffer coordinates of the pixel content, in case a buffer_transform or a buffer_scale is used.</p><p>A surface without a &quot;role&quot; is fairly useless: a compositor does not know where, when or how to present it. The role is the purpose of a wl_surface. Examples of roles are a cursor for a pointer (as set by wl_pointer.set_cursor), a drag icon (wl_data_device.start_drag), a sub-surface (wl_subcompositor.get_subsurface), and a window as defined by a shell protocol (e.g. wl_shell.get_shell_surface).</p><p>A surface can have only one role at a time. Initially a wl_surface does not have a role. Once a wl_surface is given a role, it is set permanently for the whole lifetime of the wl_surface object. Giving the current role again is allowed, unless explicitly forbidden by the relevant interface specification.</p><p>Surface roles are given by requests in other interfaces such as wl_pointer.set_cursor. The request should explicitly mention that this request gives a role to a wl_surface. Often, this request also creates a new protocol object that represents the role and adds additional functionality to wl_surface. When a client wants to destroy a wl_surface, they must destroy this 'role object' before the wl_surface.</p><p>Destroying the role object does not remove the role from the wl_surface, but it may stop the wl_surface from &quot;playing the role&quot;. For instance, if a wl_subsurface object is destroyed, the wl_surface it was created for will be unmapped and forget its position and z-order. It is allowed to create a wl_subsurface for the same wl_surface again, but it is not allowed to use the wl_surface as a cursor (cursor is a different role than sub-surface, and role switching is not allowed).</p><nav class="toc"><ul><li><a href="#version-1">Version 1</a></li><li><a href="#version-2">Version 2</a></li><li><a href="#version-3">Version 3</a></li><li><a href="#version-4">Version 4</a></li></ul></nav></header><dl><dt class="spec type" id="type-t"><a href="#type-t" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">type</span> <span>'v t</span></code><code> = <span><span>(<span>[ `Wl_surface ]</span>, <span class="type-var">'v</span>)</span> <a href="../../Wayland/Proxy/index.html#type-t">Wayland.Proxy.t</a></span></code></dt></dl><section><header><h3 id="version-1"><a href="#version-1" class="anchor"></a>Version 1</h3></header><dl><dt class="spec value" id="val-commit"><a href="#val-commit" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">val</span> commit : <span><span class="type-var">'v</span> <a href="index.html#type-t">t</a></span> <span>&#45;&gt;</span> unit</code></dt><dd><p>Commit pending surface state.</p><p>Surface state (input, opaque, and damage regions, attached buffers, etc.) is double-buffered.

After commit, there is no pending buffer until the next attach.</p><p>Committing a pending wl_buffer allows the compositor to read the pixels in the wl_buffer. The compositor may access the pixels at any time after the wl_surface.commit request. When the compositor will not access the pixels anymore, it will send the wl_buffer.release event. Only after receiving wl_buffer.release, the client may reuse the wl_buffer. A wl_buffer that has been attached and then replaced by another attach instead of committed will not receive a release event, and is not used by the compositor.</p><p>If a pending wl_buffer has been committed to more than one wl_surface, the delivery of wl_buffer.release events becomes undefined. A well behaved client should not rely on wl_buffer.release events in this case. Alternatively, a client could create multiple wl_buffer objects from the same backing storage or use wp_linux_buffer_release.</p><p>Destroying the wl_buffer after wl_buffer.release does not change the surface contents. However, if the client destroys the wl_buffer before receiving the wl_buffer.release event, the surface contents become undefined immediately.</p><p>If wl_surface.attach is sent with a NULL wl_buffer, the following wl_surface.commit will remove the surface content.</p></dd></dl><dl><dt class="spec value" id="val-destroy"><a href="#val-destroy" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">val</span> destroy : <span><span class="type-var">'v</span> <a href="index.html#type-t">t</a></span> <span>&#45;&gt;</span> unit</code></dt><dd><p>Delete surface.</p><p>Deletes the surface and invalidates its object ID.</p></dd></dl><div class="spec class" id="class-h1"><a href="#class-h1" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="keyword">virtual</span> 'v <a href="class-h1/index.html">h1</a> : <span class="keyword">object</span> ... <span class="keyword">end</span></code></div><dl><dt class="spec value" id="val-v1"><a href="#val-v1" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">val</span> v1 : <span><span class="type-var">'v</span> <a href="class-h1/index.html">h1</a></span> <span>&#45;&gt;</span> <span><span>(<span>[ `Wl_surface ]</span>, <span class="type-var">'v</span>, <span>[&lt; `V1 ]</span>, <span>[&gt; `V1 ]</span>)</span> <a href="../../Wayland/Proxy/index.html#type-handler">Wayland.Proxy.handler</a></span></code></dt></dl></section><section><header><h3 id="version-2"><a href="#version-2" class="anchor"></a>Version 2</h3></header><dl><dt class="spec value" id="val-set_buffer_transform"><a href="#val-set_buffer_transform" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">val</span> set_buffer_transform : <span><span class="type-var">'v</span> <a href="index.html#type-t">t</a></span> <span>&#45;&gt;</span> <span>transform:int32</span> <span>&#45;&gt;</span> unit</code></dt><dd><p>Sets the buffer transformation.</p><p>This request sets an optional transformation on how the compositor interprets the contents of the buffer attached to the surface.
