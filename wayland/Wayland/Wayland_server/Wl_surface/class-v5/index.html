This means that at commit time the supplied buffer size must be an integer multiple of the buffer_scale. If that's not the case, an invalid_size error is sent.</p><p>The x and y arguments specify the location of the new pending buffer's upper left corner, relative to the current buffer's upper left corner, in surface-local coordinates. In other words, the x and y, combined with the new surface size define in which directions the surface's size changes. Setting anything other than 0 as x and y arguments is discouraged, and should instead be replaced with using the separate wl_surface.offset request.</p><p>When the bound wl_surface version is 5 or higher, passing any non-zero x or y is a protocol violation, and will result in an 'invalid_offset' error being raised. The x and y arguments are ignored and do not change the pending state. To achieve equivalent semantics, use wl_surface.offset.</p><p>Surface contents are double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.</p><p>The initial surface contents are void; there is no content. wl_surface.attach assigns the given wl_buffer as the pending wl_buffer. wl_surface.commit makes the pending wl_buffer the new surface contents, and the size of the surface becomes the size calculated from the wl_buffer, as described above. After commit, there is no pending buffer until the next attach.</p><p>Committing a pending wl_buffer allows the compositor to read the pixels in the wl_buffer. The compositor may access the pixels at any time after the wl_surface.commit request. When the compositor will not access the pixels anymore, it will send the wl_buffer.release event. Only after receiving wl_buffer.release, the client may reuse the wl_buffer. A wl_buffer that has been attached and then replaced by another attach instead of committed will not receive a release event, and is not used by the compositor.</p><p>If a pending wl_buffer has been committed to more than one wl_surface, the delivery of wl_buffer.release events becomes undefined. A well behaved client should not rely on wl_buffer.release events in this case. Alternatively, a client could create multiple wl_buffer objects from the same backing storage or use wp_linux_buffer_release.</p><p>Destroying the wl_buffer after wl_buffer.release does not change the surface contents. Destroying the wl_buffer before wl_buffer.release is allowed as long as the underlying buffer storage isn't re-used (this can happen e.g. on client process termination). However, if the client destroys the wl_buffer before receiving the wl_buffer.release event and mutates the underlying buffer storage, the surface contents become undefined immediately.</p><p>If wl_surface.attach is sent with a NULL wl_buffer, or the pending wl_buffer has been destroyed, the following wl_surface.commit will remove the surface content.</p><div class="odoc-spec"><div class="spec method anchored" id="method-on_damage"><a href="#method-on_damage" class="anchor"></a><code><span><span class="keyword">method</span> <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">virtual</span> on_damage : <span><span><span>[&gt; `V5 <span>| `V6</span> ]</span> <a href="../index.html#type-t">t</a></span> <span class="arrow">&#45;&gt;</span></span>

This is useful for throttling redrawing operations, and driving animations.</p><p>When a client is animating on a wl_surface, it can use the 'frame' request to get notified when it is a good time to draw and commit the next frame of animation. If the client commits an update earlier than that, it is likely that some updates will not make it to the display, and the client is wasting resources by drawing too often.</p><p>The frame request will take effect on the next wl_surface.commit. The notification will only be posted for one frame unless requested again. For a wl_surface, the notifications are posted in the order the frame requests were committed.</p><p>The server must send the notifications so that a client will not send excessive updates, while still allowing the highest possible update rate for clients that wait for the reply before drawing again.
