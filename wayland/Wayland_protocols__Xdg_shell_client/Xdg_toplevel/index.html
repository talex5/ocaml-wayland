All active operations (e.g., move, resize) are canceled and all attributes (e.g. title, state, stacking, ...) are discarded for an xdg_toplevel surface when it is unmapped. The xdg_toplevel returns to the state it had right after xdg_surface.get_toplevel. The client can re-map the toplevel by perfoming a commit without any buffer attached, waiting for a configure event and handling it as usual (see xdg_surface description).</p><p>Attaching a null buffer to a toplevel unmaps the surface.</p><nav class="toc"><ul><li><a href="#version-1,-2,-3">Version 1, 2, 3</a></li><li><a href="#handlers">Handlers</a></li></ul></nav></header><dl><dt class="spec type" id="type-t"><a href="#type-t" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">type</span> <span>'v t</span></code><code> = <span><span>(<span>[ `Xdg_toplevel ]</span>, <span class="type-var">'v</span>, <span>[ `Client ]</span>)</span> <a href="../$Open__4_95/index.html#module-$Proxy">$Proxy</a>.t</span></code></dt></dl><div class="spec module" id="module-Resize_edge"><a href="#module-Resize_edge" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">module</span> Resize_edge = <a href="../../Wayland_protocols/Xdg_shell_proto/Xdg_toplevel/index.html#module-Resize_edge">Wayland_protocols.Xdg_shell_proto.Xdg_toplevel.Resize_edge</a></code></div><div class="spec module" id="module-State"><a href="#module-State" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">module</span> State = <a href="../../Wayland_protocols/Xdg_shell_proto/Xdg_toplevel/index.html#module-State">Wayland_protocols.Xdg_shell_proto.Xdg_toplevel.State</a></code></div><section><header><h3 id="version-1,-2,-3"><a href="#version-1,-2,-3" class="anchor"></a>Version 1, 2, 3</h3></header><dl><dt class="spec value" id="val-set_minimized"><a href="#val-set_minimized" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">val</span> set_minimized : <span><span>[&lt; `V1 <span>| `V2</span> <span>| `V3</span> ]</span> <a href="index.html#type-t">t</a></span> <span>&#45;&gt;</span> unit</code></dt><dd><p>Set the window as minimized.</p><p>Request that the compositor minimize your surface.
